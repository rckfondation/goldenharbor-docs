# Golden Harbor - Building a Community-Driven Fishing Economy on WAX

*Not financial advice. NFTs are speculative; spend responsibly.*

---

## TL;DR
Golden Harbor is an early-stage, fishing-themed NFT game on the WAX blockchain.  
You start with a Fisherman and a Common Rod, farm Fish, unlock Boats, meet a Merchant, and mint Gold, all through fully on-chain blends whose odds and burn rules are public on NeftyBlocks.

---

## 1  Why Another Fishing Game?
Most idle NFT titles feel pay-to-win and hide their math. Golden Harbor flips that script:

* **Provably fair** â€“ every blend is an on-chain AtomicAssets action anyone can audit.  
* **Burn-to-earn** â€“ supply sinks are hard-coded via blending; nothing inflates forever.  
* **Player governance** â€“ future balance changes will be polled publicly in Discord.

## 2  Core Loop (Alpha v0.1)

1. Starter Pack â†’ Fisherman + Common Rod  
2. Stake both assets to farm *Fish* (utility token)  
3. Blend Fisherman + Rod for a low-odds chance to pull a Rowboat  
4. Rowboat unlocks five rarity-based blends; each returns one of three chest packs:  
   *Fish Crate, Seanet Crate, Harbor Vault*  
5. Open chests for better Rods, extra Fish, and an occasional Merchant NPC  
6. Merchant converts Fish into Gold; Gold will buy premium packs and upgrades in future phases

## 3  Fair-Launch Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| No team pre-mint | Devs buy packs in public drops like everyone else |
| Transparent odds | Blend weights are published and immutable |
| Deflationary design | All input NFTs are burned during blending |
| Revenue split 80 / 20 | 80 % liquidity plus buy-back pool, 20 % art plus infrastructure |
